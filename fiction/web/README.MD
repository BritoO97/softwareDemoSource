This is the web demo of the scraper created to scrape fanfictions from fanfiction.net to be able to archive them for later reading<br>
Written for Python 3.6 or 3.7 with a handler written in Python 2 to allow Flask compatibility<br>

Differences:<br>
	Functions much the same as the original, except that the ficHandler.py script will then compress the directory and delete the original.<br>

Output:<br>
	The resulting zip file is returned to the client page and downloaded.<br>
